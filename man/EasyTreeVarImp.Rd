\title{
Variable importance for conditional inference trees.
}
\description{
Variable importance for \code{partykit} conditional inference trees, using various performance measures.
}
\usage{
EasyTreeVarImp(ct, nsim = 1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{ct}{A tree of class \code{constparty} (as returned by \code{ctree} from \code{partykit} package).}
  \item{nsim}{Integer specifying the number of Monte Carlo replications to perform. Default is 1. If nsim > 1, the results from each replication are simply averaged together.}
}

\details{
If the response variable is a factor, AUC (if response is binary), accuracy, balanced accuracy and true predictions by class are used. If the response is numeric, r-squared and Kendall's tau are used.
}

\value{
A data frame of variable importances, with variables as rows and performance measures as columns.
