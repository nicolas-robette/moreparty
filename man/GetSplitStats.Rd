\title{
Permutation tests results for each split in a conditional tree.
}
\description{
This function displays the results the selection variable process for each split of a conditional tree, i.e. the p-values from permutation tests of independence between every predictor and the dependent variable. This may help to assess the stability of the tree.
}
\usage{
GetSplitStats(ct)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{ct}{A tree of class \code{BinaryTree} (as returned by \code{ctree} from \code{party} package) or \code{constparty} (as returned by \code{ctree} from \code{partykit} package).}
}

\value{
A list of elements, one for each split in the tree. For each split, the vector corresponds to are log(1-p) for every predictors, with p the p-value of the permutation test of independence. Variables are sorted by decreasing degree of association with the dependent variable.
