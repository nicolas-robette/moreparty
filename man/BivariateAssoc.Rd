\title{
Bivariate association measures for supervised learning tasks.
}
\description{
Computes bivariate association measures between a response and predictor variables (and, optionnaly, between every couples of predictor variables.)
}
\usage{
BivariateAssoc(Y, X, xx = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{Y}{the response variable}

  \item{X}{the predictor variables}

  \item{xx}{whether the association measures should be computed for couples of predictor variables (default) or not. With a lot of predictors, consider setting xx to FALSE (for reasons fo computation time).}
}

\details{
For each pair of variable, a permutation test is computed, following the framework used in conditional inference trees to choose a splitting variable. This test produces a p-value, transformed as log(1-p) for reasons of comparison stability. The function also computes a "standard" association measure : kenddal's tau correlation for pairs of numeric variables, Cramer's V for pairs of factors and eta-squared for pairs numeric-factor.}

\value{
A list of the following items :
\item{YX}{: a table with the association measures between the response and predictor variables}
\item{XX}{: a table with the association measures between every couples of predictor variables}
In each table :
\item{p.value}{: p-value from the permutation test}
\item{criterion}{: p-value transformed as log(1-p), which serves to sort rows}
\item{measure}{: name of the "standard" association measure}
\item{assoc}{: value of the "standard" association measure}
}
