    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl><dt>formula</dt>
<dd><p>a symbolic description of the model to be fit. Note that symbols like <code>:</code> and <code>-</code> will not work and the tree will make use of all variables listed on the rhs of <code>formula</code></p></dd>

  <dt>data</dt>
<dd><p>a data frame containing the variables in the model</p></dd>

  <dt>subset</dt>
<dd><p>an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used in the fitting process</p></dd>

  <dt>weights</dt>
<dd><p>an optional vector of weights to be used in the fitting process. Non-negative integer valued weights are allowed as well as non-negative real weights. Observations are sampled (with or without replacement) according to probabilities <code>weights / sum(weights)</code>. The fraction of observations to be sampled (without replacement) is computed based on the sum of the weights if all weights are integer-valued and based on the number of weights greater zero else. Alternatively, <code>weights</code> can be a double matrix defining case weights for all <code>ncol(weights)</code> trees in the forest directly. This requires more storage but gives the user more control.</p></dd>

  <dt>controls</dt>
<dd><p>an object of class <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/party/man/ForestControl-class.html" class="external-link">ForestControl-class</a></code>, which can be obtained using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/party/man/cforest_control.html" class="external-link">cforest_control</a></code> (and its convenience interfaces <code>cforest_unbiased</code> and <code>cforest_classical</code>).</p></dd>

  <dt>xtrafo</dt>
<dd><p>a function to be applied to all input variables. By default, the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/party/man/Transformations.html" class="external-link">ptrafo</a></code> function is applied.</p></dd>

  <dt>ytrafo</dt>
<dd><p>a function to be applied to all response variables. By default, the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/party/man/Transformations.html" class="external-link">ptrafo</a></code> function is applied.</p></dd>

  <dt>scores</dt>
<dd><p>an optional named list of scores to be attached to ordered factors</p></dd>

  <dt>parallel</dt>
<dd><p>Logical indicating whether or not to run <code>fastcforest</code> in parallel using a backend provided by the <code>foreach</code> package. Default is <code>TRUE</code>.</p></dd>
